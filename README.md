The goal of this document is to provide some suggestions and guidelines for Jabber scribes 
at IETF meetings. The idea is to capture some of the practices that are used by frequent Jabber scribes and also the desired experiences by remote attendees.
 
If you have suggestions please contact Dan York at dyork@lodestar2.com
